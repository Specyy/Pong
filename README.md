# Pong

A simple remake of the classic Pong game using Java's AWT rendering API.

> Note: This version was recovered from a decompiled `.jar` file due to the original source code being lost.

## Features

- Two-player local gameplay
- Software rendered using Java AWT
- Lightweight implementation with no external dependencies
- Keyboard-based input handling (W/S for player 1, Up/Down for player 2)
